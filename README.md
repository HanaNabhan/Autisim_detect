# Autism Image Classification

This project involves the classification of images to detect autistic and non-autistic individuals based on a given dataset. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for training and validation of the image data.


## Project Overview
This repository contains a deep learning model to classify autism-related images into two categories: Autistic and Non-Autistic. The model was trained using a dataset consisting of images of both autistic and non-autistic individuals. The architecture used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow/Keras.

### Key Features:
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model for image classification
- Training, validation, and testing of the model
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
